                                A group of dedicated, passionate teachers  and a slightly tone-deaf principal 
                                find themselves thrown together in a Philadelphia public school where, despite 
                                the odds stacked against them, they are determined to help their students succeed 
                                in life. Though these incredible public servants may be outnumbered and underfunded, 
                                they love what they do even if they don't love the school district's less than stellar 
                                attitude toward educating children.

                                Contestants are selected through public auditions and trained by a panel of four coaches 
                                who guide and critique their performances in an attempt to discover America's next great 
                                voice. The season is presented by Carson Daly, who returns for his twenty-third season as 
                                host. The panel of coaches for the season consists of Blake Shelton, who returns for his 
                                twenty-third and final season as a coach; returning coach Kelly Clarkson, who returns for
